# IO architecture

## There is more to "Hello world"

One of the first things most people getting into a language see is a such:

```elixir
IO.puts("hello world")
```

Seems obvious and predictable, doesn't it? Well, let's do it more explicitly:

```elixir
pid = Process.group_leader()

IO.puts(pid, "hello world")
```

This in turn looks far more interesting! In fact, there is much more to *hello world*
than you might expect, so bear with me.

## What is IO anyway?

Regardless the programming language at hand, whenever you run a program
it usually has two channels attached - one responsible for reading whatever you type
(input) and one responsible for writing text to the screen (output). Generally the program
perceives these channels as regular files.

So whenever you see text printed in your terminal, it is a result of the given program
writing to a specific file. In many languages calling IO related functions operates
directly on that file. For example, in C we could achieve this with `printf("hello world\n")`
and a more explicit counterpart would be `write(1, "hello world\n", 12)`,
where `1` represents the output file.

Erlang (thus Elixir) is no exception to that, but there is some clever abstraction
behind the scenes! In the example above we called `IO.puts/2` with *some* process identifier,
but given how ubiquitous processes are in Erlang, it's no wonder they are involved
when working with IO as well.

## The Erlang I/O Protocol

All the common functions in the `IO` (or `:io`) module operate on
so called **devices**. Let's look at the docs:

```elixir
import IEx.Helpers

h(IO.write())
```

```elixir
t(IO.device())
```

As you can see **device** is either a PID or an atom representing some process.
This means all those `IO` functions actually send messages to the whatever process
we specify! Consequently, such process must expect messages of certain shape and know how
to respond accordingly - sure enough, that's specified precisely by
[The Erlang I/O Protocol](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/io_protocol.html).

Let's have some fun and write our own device!

```elixir
defmodule IODev do
  @moduledoc """
  A simple IO device implementing the The Erlang I/O Protocol.
  """

  use GenServer

  def start_link() do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [])
  end

  @doc """
  Lists all IO requests sent to this device.
  """
  def get_requests(pid) do
    GenServer.call(pid, :get_requests)
  end

  @impl true
  def init(_opts) do
    {:ok, %{requests: []}}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call(:get_requests, _from, state) do
    {:reply, Enum.reverse(state.requests), state}
  end

  # Below we handle the actual IO requests

  @impl true
  def handle_info({:io_request, from, reply_as, request}, state) do
    # Send reply to the process that requested IO
    send(from, {:io_reply, reply_as, :ok})

    # Store all the incoming requests
    state = update_in(state.requests, &[request | &1])

    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

Our device is ready, let's take it for a spin!

```elixir
# Remember that IO device is a regular process,
# it just has to correctly handle certain messages.
{:ok, io_dev} = IODev.start_link()
```

```elixir
# Each of these functions should send a request to our device
IO.puts(io_dev, "hello world")
IO.write(io_dev, "you there?")
IO.gets(io_dev, "what's you name?")
```

As you can see the above code produced no output and that's because our device does
no such thing. It does however store the requests, so let's see what it got:

```elixir
IODev.get_requests(io_dev)
```

Awesome! The requests are very clear and it's up to the given device what to do with them.
The default device writes to the standard output accordingly, while our device only
keeps track of the requests.

## Group leader

So now you may be wondering what actually happens when you write `IO.puts("hello world")`
without specifying the device. Under the default configuration this sends
an IO request to the default device, which writes/reads to the input/output files
described earlier.

Which process is this default device though? Here things get even more interesting!
Each process has so called **group leader**, which is precisely a process that serves
as the default IO device. Group leader can be set dynamically and we can actually
test that too:

```elixir
# Get the current group leader
original_group_leader = Process.group_leader()
# Set our custom device as the new group leader
Process.group_leader(self(), io_dev)
# Apply an IO action, this should send message to the new group leader
IO.puts("hey group leader, sup?")
# Revert back to the original
Process.group_leader(self(), original_group_leader)

IODev.get_requests(io_dev)
```

Alright, there are two more pieces to our puzzle. Firstly, it's important to note that
whenever a process spawns a new process, the group leader is **inherited**.
Secondly, when the Erlang runtime starts, the initial processes have their group leader
set to `:user`, which is nothing more than a device whose job is to read/write
to the output/input files.

This implies that unless configured otherwise, most processes will have the `:user` process
set as their group leader, so calls like `IO.puts("hello world")` will send IO request to
the `:user` process, which in turn writes to the screen! 🕵️

## Use cases

The IO device abstraction is amazingly flexible and allows for pretty powerful things.
Let's have a look at some real world examples.

### StringIO

Elixir itself comes with the [StringIO](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/StringIO.html) device,
which buffers all the outputs and then returns them as a string.

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = StringIO.open("")
IO.write(pid, "how")
IO.write(pid, " are")
IO.write(pid, " you")
StringIO.flush(pid)
```

More notably, it's exatlywhat `ExUnit.CaptureIO` uses under the hood!

```elixir
ExUnit.CaptureIO.capture_io(fn ->
  IO.puts("🚀🚀🚀")
end)
```

### Livebook

Whenever you use the `IO` module Livebook immediately shows all output,
even though we are not in a terminal window. A quick guess could be that `StringIO`
is behind this as well, but that's not the case! Livebook needs to show the output
during evaluation, as soon as it is produced. Let's see an example for a better illustration:

```elixir
for n <- 1..5 do
  IO.puts("Step #{n}")
  Process.sleep(300)
end
```

Internally the code is evaluated by a separate process, but before this happens
we set its group leader to a dedicated IO device, whose job is to send the outputs
directly to the process responsible for notebook state.

### Erlang Distribution

Finally, this IO architecture has important implications for distributed setup.
Let's assume node `:a@hostname` evalutes the following code:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Node.spawn(:b@hostname, fn ->
  IO.puts("where should I print?")
end)
```

A process on `:a@hostname` spawns another process on `:b@hostname`, but the group leader
is inherited as usually. This means that the spawned process points to group leader
somewhere on `:a@hostname` and that's where the result of `IO.puts/1` goes.
In other words, the code evaluates on the other node, but any output gets back
to the original node. Feels elegant, doesn't it?

## Final notes

In this notebook we had a quick tour of the IO architecture in Erlang and Elixir
and went through several examples of leveraging this architecure to our advantage.
